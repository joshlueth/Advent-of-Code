# Repository Information

This is a repository for Advent of Code, created November 30th, 2024.

# Motivation

I decided to do Advent of Code this year in order to learn C++. The goal would be to gain a grasp of the basic features and compare it to FORTRAN as a basis for a Finite Element Analysis software using the Discontinuous Galerkin method, which is what my research is on.
